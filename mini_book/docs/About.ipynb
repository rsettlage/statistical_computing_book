    "As mentioned on the front page, the purpose of this series of courses is to teach the basics of Bayesian statistics for the purpose of performing inference. This is *not* intended to be a comprehensive course that teaches the basics of statistics and probability nor does it cover Frequentist statistical techniques based on the Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). What it does cover is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The basics of Bayesian probability\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understanding Bayesian inference and how it works\n",
    "\n",
    "* The bare-minimum set of tools and a body of knowledge required to perform Bayesian inference in Python, i.e. the PyData stack of NumPy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plot.ly\n",
    "\n",
    "* A scalable Python-based framework for performing Bayesian inference, i.e. PyMC3\n",
    "\n",
    "With this goal in mind, the content is divided into the following three main sections.\n",

    "* Introduction to Bayesian Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods\n",

    "* PyMC3 for Bayesian Modeling and Inference"
