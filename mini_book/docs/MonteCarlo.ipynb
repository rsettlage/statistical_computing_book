The Poisson distribution is a special case of this binomial distribution and is used when the trials far exceed the number of successes.\n",

    "Based on the solution of differential equations known as Hamilton's equations. These differential equations depend on the probability distributions we are trying to learn. We navigate these distributions by moving around them in a trajectory using steps that are defined by a position and momentum at that position. Navigating these trajectories can be a very expensive process and the goal is to minimize this computational process.\n",
    "\n",
    "HMC is based on the notion of conservation of energy. When the sampler trajectory is far away from the probability mass center, it has high potential energy but low kinetic energy and when it is closer to the center of the probability mass will have high kinetic energy but low potential energy."
