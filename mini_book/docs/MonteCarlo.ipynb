    "Based on the solution of differential equations known as Hamilton's equations. These differential equations depend on the probability distributions we are trying to learn. We navigate these distributions by moving around them in a trajectory using steps that are defined by a position and momentum at that position. Navigating these trajectories can be a very expensive process and the goal is to minimize this computational process."
