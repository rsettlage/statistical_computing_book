    "### Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last section, we gave an example taking of a test for determining status of disease.  We took the test and discovered a positive result which led to a probability that we are truly infected given the postivite test of 79%.  The odds are, we have the disease.  Are we sure enough that we will seek appropriate treatment or perhaps we want a second opinion?  Is there a second test?  Do we simply take two tests and combine the results?  When we build a computational model, we repeatedly ask this question and have to make a decision, do we continue in the current direction or go from whence we came. The consequences of making a wrong choice are often not symmetric.  Our overall goal is to simply be right, but understanding consequence discrepancies may suggest wrong answers are not all the same.  In this example we may choose to weigh a wrong answer differently in one direction than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Restating this in terms of probability, for a binary decision, our goal is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{argmin } p(mistake) = \\sum_{i=1}^k p(x_{k \\notin j},C_k)$ where j/k are class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rejection regions or decision boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In our decision, we may choose a region for inclusion in one class or another, for instance, we may decide the optimal boundary in our disease classification is at $p(disease|+test)>75%$.  Note that the decision boundary should parition the space.  Written with a decision boundary, \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{argmin } p(mistake) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R_1}} p(x,C_2) dx + \\int_{\\mathbb{R_2}} p(x,C_1) dx$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the coin toss experiment, after we perform the experiment many times, we can arrange the data and find the regions to the right/left that give the desired partions between 'fair' and 'biased' based on our tolerance for error."
