# Statistical Computing with PyMC3 


This series of notebooks and material is being put together by Dr.Srijith Rajamohan. The purpose of this series is to teach the basics of Bayesian statistics for the purpose of performing Inference. This is not intended to be a comprehensive course that teaches the basics of statistics and probability nor does it cover Frequentist statistical techniques based on the Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). What it does cover is:

* The basics of Bayesian probability
* Understanding Bayesian inference and how it works
* The bare-minimum set of tools and a body of knowledge required to perform Bayesian inference in Python, i.e. the PyData stack of NumPy, Pandas, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plot.ly
* A scalable Python-based framework for performing Bayesian inference, i.e. PyMC3

With this goal in mind, the content is divided into the following three main sections.

*  Introduction to Bayesian Statistics 
*  Introduction to Monte Carlo simulation
*  Introduction to PyMC3 for Monte Carlo simulations


```{note}
This draws a lot of inspiration from some brilliant people in this field and I will list those names here as this work is being developed.
