    "\n",
    "In order to sample data from a particular distribution we can start with a uniform continuous distribution between 0 and 1 denoted as U[0,1]. The probability of picking a value less than 'a' that is between 0 and 1 is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(x < a) = a$\n",
    "\n",
    "but because there are infinite possibilities between 0 and 1, the probability of picking any particular value 'a' is close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a discrete uniform distribution from 0 to 'n' denoted as U{0,1,...n-1}, this set has 'n' samples and the probability of choosing any discrete value 'a' is \n",
    "\n",
    "$P(x = a) = \\dfrac{1}{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "since this is a discrete value and there are a finite number of elements in this set. One way to convert this continuous uniform distribution U[0,1] to the discrete distribution U{0,1,...n-1} is through the transformation X = [[n U]] where I have used the notation [[ ]] for rounding the values within to the nearest integer. Now\n",

    "#### Arbitrary Discrete Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate an arbitrary distribution, we can use the continuous uniform distribution and sample from it followed by a transform such that we get our desired distribution. In the figure below, we have divided the uniform continuous distribution U[0,1] into uneven lengths given by $p_1, p_2, p_3...p_n$ (here n = 5) such that $\\sum p_i = 1$\n",
