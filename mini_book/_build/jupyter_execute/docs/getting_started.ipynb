    "\n",
    "Databricks offers a [Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html) of their Data Science ecosystem for running experiments and notebooks. You can sign up for a free account and start running the notebooks for the course. The advantages for using Databricks over other Data Science ecosystems:\n",

    "* Integration with MLflow for experiment management\n",
    "* Integration with Git for version control of your notebooks\n",
    "* Collaboration with peers with the ability to comment on your notebooks\n",

    "## Binder\n",
    "\n",
    "One you are on a course page that has a Jupyter Notebook, click on the tab located at the top right corner of the page and select 'Binder'. This deploys the notebook onto a cloud environment. This automatically pulls the Docker image and creates a working Python environment for you without any user intervention. This is the easiest way to get started using the notebooks. However, any changes made in the notebooks will not be persistent. If persistence is desired, it is recommended to use the Databricks Community Edition.\n",
